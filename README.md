# Rossum's Embedded mode

Rossum validation interface can be embedded into a third-party app. That allows users to enjoy the Rossum validation interface (with its speedy validation and AI feedback) while keeping the app they use.  No extra login is required, a document is directly shown to the user and on confirming it, the user is immediately returned to the app.

This small project showcases this capability. It demoes three ways to embed Rossum in an external app: redirect-based (the standard way), popup-based and iframe-based. After validation is completed, the captured data is shown on the page.
